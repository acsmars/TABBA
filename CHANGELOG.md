# Changelog

## v0.1.0 (23/07/2019)

This is the initial release for TABBA!

Please check out the [wiki](https://github.com/lukecarr/TABBA/wiki) where you can find guides on getting started with the plugin!

In this version there are 5 barrel tiers, however the barrel upgrade items have not been implemented yet. This will be implemented in v0.1.1; in the meantime, you can only create barrels with the lowest tier (they hold 64 stacks).

*You will also need to grab a copy of [Anvil](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/anvil.69610/) which TABBA requires to function.*
