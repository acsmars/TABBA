> Tinkererr Attempts a Better Barrel Addon (TABBA) is a Spigot 1.14 plugin which changes the vanilla barrel to be a mass storage solution for one item type.

## Getting Started

The following instructions should get your server setup with TABBA in no time!

### Prerequisites

You will need the following to use TABBA on your server:
- **A working Minecraft server running Spigot 1.14.x.** We support (and actively recommend) [PaperMC](https://papermc.io) in place of Spigot!
- **A copy of [Anvil](https://github.com/lukecarr/Anvil).** This is an API that TABBA requires to function.

*TABBA does not work with any Minecraft version prior to 1.14. The plugin utilises the barrel block that was introduced with 1.14 therefore there is no chance of a future release with legacy Minecraft version support.*

That's it! TABBA has been designed from the start to require no other external dependencies and work out of the box!

### Installation

Simply grab a copy of TABBA from the **[releases page](https://github.com/lukecarr/TABBA/releases)** where you can find all versions of the plugin! Drag and drop your newly downloaded JAR file into your server's `/plugins` directory and you're good to go! Be sure to check what version you are downloading: versions ending with `-alpha`, `-beta`, and `-rc` are not stable releases - use these at your own risk!

> Be careful when downloading version of TABBA from locations other than this Github project page or Spigot. I have never, and will never, charge for TABBA so if someone is requiring payment for a download of the plugin steer clear! I am not responsible for any harm caused by versions of this plugin acquired from sites other than `github.com/lukecarr/TABBA` or `spigotmc.org`, nor will I provide support for any versions of TABBA downloaded from external locations.

## Built With
